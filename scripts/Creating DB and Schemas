-- Create a new database named 'DataWarehouse'.
-- This will serve as the main container for your data warehouse project.
CREATE DATABASE DataWarehouse;

-- Switch context to the newly created 'DataWarehouse' database

USE DataWarehouse;

-- Create a schema named 'bronze'.
-- This layer typically holds raw, untransformed data directly ingested from source systems.
